# Pokémon Emerald Optimized

This is a lightly optimized patch of Pokémon Emerald based on the [decompilation files](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald). The goal of this hack is to maintain as close to a vanilla experience as possible while introducing a few key quality of life improvements. I built this as a personal optimization file after being dissatisfied with how extreme extant Emerald hacks are. Features of this hack currently include: 

- The entire Hoenn Dex is available in one save file, with trade evolutions edited to remove the whole, well, trading thing. 
- All special ferry events for legendary Pokémon are available. The tickets are scattered throughout Hoenn and flags are set such that all events are playable immediately upon beating the Elite Four. 
- Almost all Kanto and Johto Pokémon are available after beating the Elite Four, with the exception of regional starters and legendary/mythical Pokémon. (I'm considering adding these as standalone events / roaming / etc. in future versions.)
- TMs are reusable. 
- The final rival battle in Lilycove City uses the fully evolved version of their starter. 
- Feebas is mildly easier to catch, appearing also in another (undisclosed) location.
- The Lucky Egg boosts experience 2.5x and the Amulet Coin boosts reward money 3x. There's a Lucky Egg in the player's PC upon beginning the game. 
- Everything costs a bit less at the Game Corner. 
- You can run indoors. 
- Text speed is set to fast by default. 
- Evolution stones are purchasable at the Battle Frontier. 
- Mirage Island appears after beating the Elite Four, with an overhauled encounter table of some of my personal favorites. 
- This is a small arbitrary irritation: Masquerain now maintains Surskit's Bug/Water typing, with a slightly revised moveset. 

The following are stretch goals for future versions: 

- Gently revise movesets to give lesser-used Pokémon a boost. 
- Make TMs sell out at PokéMarts after purchasing. Right now, if you buy multiple TMs, nothing bad will happen but you'll just waste money.

Features I don't plan on introducing: 

- Decapitalization. I don't object to it, but decap bases are inconsistent and the work is more tedious than I care to do. Here's a patch if you'd like to add it yourself: [https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=327901](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=327901).
- The physical/special split. I *might* add this later down the road, but I believe that doing so would require rebalancing basically every trainer in the game to take into account how different Pokémon become viable or not, plus the adjustment and/or introduction of moves that take the split into account. Emerald wasn't designed with the split so I'd rather just let it be. 

Further documentation is available on the [wiki](link). 

You can download the .ips patch to apply to a clean ROM of Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe) [here](link). The MD5 of the original ROM should be 605b89b67018abcea91e693a4dd25be3.
